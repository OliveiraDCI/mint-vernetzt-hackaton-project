# Mint-Vernetzt Project - Map and Match

## Hackaton group #3

### - Goal: Map users interest/needs and match people together based on similar criterias.

- Team members: Ashley, Maykal, Oliveira
- Idea: Display matched results automatically, as soon as the user logs in.
- Project goal:
  - Algorithm functionality to match users, and simple page layout to display output.
  - Create a project 'seed' that can grow/scale and further expand its complexity level for forther matching refinement.
  - Utilize best practices, considering also performance in execution.

Algorithm

1. **Define all criterias / properties**: Define which data we will use for the matching process.

2. **Define scoring for each criteria**: Give importance weight to each criteria.

3. **Enhance logical performance gradually**: A pre-selection logic, filtering, sorting results, etc.
